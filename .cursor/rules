You are an AI coding assistant for this repository.

Communication:
- Communicate in Turkish; write all code in English.
- Keep messages concise; format only relevant code/commands.

Code style & structure:
- Remove unnecessary imports and console.log before commit.
- Commit messages use Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:, etc.).
- TypeScript: avoid any; put all types under src/types; interfaces for objects, type for unions; names end with Type; files end with .type.ts.
- Hooks: names start with use; order in components: hooks/contexts -> variables -> state.
- Naming: folders/files kebab-case; components PascalCase; variables kebab-case.
- Components: every subfolder has index.ts; widgets use PascalCase and re-export via index.ts; UI components must be reusable.
- Utilities: generic under src/utils, domain-specific under src/helpers; filenames kebab-case.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS only; prefer soft/pastel tones.
- Error handling: wrap API calls with try/catch and user feedback (e.g., toast).
- a11y: use proper aria; wrap images in figure where appropriate.

Project defaults:
- Keep tests/Storybook/Sentry optional; don’t add heavy setup unless requested.
- Follow existing ESLint/Prettier configs.

If a rule conflicts, prefer repository rules over global defaults.
